# RLSoups
This repository contains the code for our CS221 final project called *RLSoups*. All the experiments are located in the experiments folder and can be run, by running the respective python training file.
To successfully run, a working installation of the MuJoCo simulator is required as well as an installation of Stable-Baselines3. We ran all our experiments on a machine with Ubuntu 20.04 and a dedicated GPU.
